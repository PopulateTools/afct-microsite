<h1>Multi-stakeholder discussion platform</h1>

In 2020, Frank Bold initiated a process to build multi-stakeholder consensus on the reform of the EU legal framework on corporate sustainability reporting. As part of its work in the Alliance for Corporate Transparency, Frank Bold drafted a “model law” that was consulted and discussed with NGOs, trade unions as well as with 30 sustainability leaders from companies and investor firms. 

The resulting proposals include detailed suggestions to review the disclosure obligations of the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (and future EU standards) both in terms of structure and content. 

You can download the “model law” here: <a href="">LINK TO PDF</a>

Together with the evidence gathered through the research, this work aims to involve and engage key progressive actors in a constructive debate in order to provide useful recommendations to EU and national regulators as well as to supervisory authorities, preparers and users of corporate sustainability data. This work is essential to break down the traditional barriers and tendencies to work in silos.
