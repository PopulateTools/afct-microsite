<h1>Multi-stakeholder discussion</h1>

The Alliance for Corporate Transparency brings together civil society organisations working on critical sustainability issues with the objective of improving the EU legal framework for corporate sustainability reporting and developing mandatory EU standards.

As coordinator of this initiative, Frank Bold established the following spaces in order to facilitate an open exchange of views on EU and international reforms for sustainable corporate disclosure.

- **Business Advisory Panel**: leading sustainability professionals working in companies at the forefront of sustainability reporting take part in this group to discuss policy developments and best practice. Advisors include: Frederic Pinglot (Schneider Electric), Michael Beutler and Nathalie Voisine (Kering), Lene Serpa (Maersk), Théo Jaekel (Ericsson), Roeland Tso (Triodos), Laura Cars (H&M) and Richard Howitt (former MEP and CEO of the IIRC currently supporting the work of Frank Bold as Senior Advisor). Kristina Seidler-Lynders (ESPRIT) participated in early stages.

- **Policy Forum**: monthly exchanges are organised with a view to develop multi-stakeholder consensus on European and global reforms on corporate transparency and responsibility. Members include: <a href="https://investorsforhumanrights.org/" target="_blank">Investor Alliance for Human Rights</a>, <a href="https://www.worldbenchmarkingalliance.org/" target="_blank">World Benchmarking Alliance</a>, <a href="https://www.unpri.org/" target="_blank">Principle for Responsible Investment</a> and <a href="https://www.eurosif.org/" target="_blank">Eurosif</a>.

Similarly, multiple events, workshops and exchanges are organised throughout the year. Please get in touch with us if you are interested to participate in the discussions or subscribe to our <a href="http://eepurl.com/dJPBjQ" target="_blank">newsletter</a> to receive updates and relevant information on future events, publications and policy debates.

<h3>Collaboration and partnerships</h3>

<h1>Context</h1>

Since 2018, large European companies and financial corporations are required to disclose information necessary to understand their societal and environmental risks and impacts. The EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, however, failed to specify which concrete information companies must disclose, severely undermining the legislation’s objective to increase the relevance, consistency and comparability of corporate sustainability data.

To address this problem, in 2019, the European Commission initiated a legislative process to reform the Directive and develop European corporate sustainability standards. High quality sustainability reporting is critical for the EU sustainable finance strategy - an ambitious roadmap to mobilise private investment to enable the implementation of the actions set out in the European Green Deal, manage climate and environmental risks and to integrate sustainability into the financial system. Corporate reporting provides the information upon which all the other elements of this strategy depend.
