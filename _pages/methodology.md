<h3>The Alliance project unfolded</h3>

<strong>Phase 1</strong>: The Alliance is formed by leading civil society organisations working in corporate sustainability and transparency that bring in specific expertise on the different areas covered by the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive.

<strong>Phase 2</strong>: The design of the research methodology is developed by the project partners, identifying the most essential ESG issues as well as the reporting criteria to analyse the information disclosed by companies in different sectors. The methodology is consulted on with external stakeholders and a trial run is carried out with partner companies to ensure the coherence of the methodology. Specific information concerning the research methodology and criteria is provided below.

<strong>Phase 3</strong>: Initial analysis of the reports of 105 companies from three sectors (ICT, Healthcare and Energy) is carried out. The project simultaneously develops an online database that stores the results and visualises the aggregated data resulting from the research as well as individual company assessments. A review mechanism is set in place. The results of this initial research are presented in Brussels on February 8, 2019.

<strong>Phase 4</strong>: The project prepares for the scale up phase by consulting, reviewing and calibrating the research methodology. The analysis in 2019-2020 aims to cover 1000 companies from all the main industrial sectors and European countries and provide all research data to the public in an open database.
