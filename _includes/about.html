  <p>Populate was founded by Álvaro Ortiz and Fernando Blat in 2015. We have been working together for more than 15 years in different projects: offering business consultancy to big cos; creating online spaces for millions of users; defining and launching startups; organizing events and participating in communities.</p>

  <p>Halfway between activism and consultancy, we are a professional services firm with numerous projects around civic engagement. We have great transparency and participation experts in Spain and Latin America as advisors.</p>

  <p>These are some things we have built in past lifes...</p>

  <p><strong>Actuable, 1 million activists in one year</strong> We created Actuable, the petitions portal which grew to +1 million members in less than a year since launch. We deployed the first version within 3 weeks and we evolved the project until it was acquired by Change.org, world leader.</p>

  <p><strong>Irekia, open government pioneers in Spain</strong> We were part of the team that conceptualized and defined Irekia, a pioneer open government portal created by the Basque Country in Spain. We developed the interaction model that articulated citizen participation facilitating processes, information architecture, and tools.</p>

  <p><strong>AbreDatos, biggest spanish open data hackathon</strong> We organized AbreDatos, the biggest open data hackathon in Spain. We started up the event with a team of volunteers from idea to execution. We engaged hundreds of participants, along with private companies and public administrations.</p>

  <p><strong>La Coctelera, a huge community</strong> We created what was the biggest blogging community in Spain and Latin America when blogs thanks to a tool designed with the user in mind, and not as technical as what was the norm at the time (around 2005).</p>

  <p>We created Populate to be able to work with a professional structure in issues that interest us: transparency, participation, data, civic engagement, media... There is a global issue that modulates many of the things we do: to foster a culture of critic use of data by citizens. Take a look at the <a href="/#projects">projects we have done recently</a>.</p>
