    </div>

    <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">

      <p>Populate is founded by Álvaro Ortiz and Fernando Blat. We have been working togehter for more than 15 years in different projects: offering business consultancy to big cos; creating online spaces for millions of users; defining and launching startups; organizing events and participating in communities. We got together again in 2015 to create Populate. We have great transparency and participation experts in Spain and Latin America as advisors.</p>

      <p>These are some of the things we created in past lifes</p>

      <div class="pure-g">

        <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 p_h_r_1 small">
          <h4>Actuable, 1 million activists in one year</h4>
          <p>We created Actuable, the petitions portal which grew to +1 million members in less than a year since launch. We deployed the first version within 3 weeks and we evolved the project until it was acquired by Change.org, world leader.</p>

        <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 p_h_l_1 small">
          <h4>Irekia, open government pioneers in Spain</h4>
          <p>We were part of the team that conceptualized and defined Irekia, a pioneer open government portal created by the Basque Country in Spain. We developed the interaction model that articulated citizen participation facilitating processes, information architecture, and tools.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 p_h_r_1 small">
          <h4>AbreDatos, biggest spanish open data hackathon</h4>
          <p>We organized AbreDatos, the biggest open data hackathon in Spain. We started up the event with a team of volunteers from idea to execution. We engaged hundreds of participants, along with private companies and public administrations.</p>

        <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2 p_h_l_1 small">
          <h4>La Coctelera, a huge community</h4>
          <p>We created what was the biggest blogging community in Spain and Latin America when blogs thanks to a tool designed with the user in mind, and not as technical as what was the norm at the time (around 2005).</p>

      <h2>What worries us</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">

      <p>We created Populate to be able to work with a proffesional structure in issues that interest us: transparency, participation, data, civic engagement, media... There is a global issue that modulates many of the things we do: to foster a culture of critic use of data by citizens. Take a look at the <a href="/#projects">projects we have done recently</a>.</p>
