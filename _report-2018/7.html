Level 3 analyses companies' reporting on their engagement with sustainable development-related business opportunities. The criteria reflect whether companies disclose their business strategies in this respect, and if they do so, if they provide quantitative and qualitative information allowing investors to understand the scope and ambition of these strategies and their actual and potential value. More granular data are provided in the report on Renewable energy systems; Energy efficiency; Green mobility; ICTs for sustainable development; Access to ICT; Access to medicines; Neglected diseases; and Innovative medicines.
