Level 2 examines the extent to which companies provide information on issues that are commonly understood as material (or salient) in their sector. These issues and the corresponding KPIs were derived from the leading sustainability reporting standards. While this provides a strong indication that these issues are material for a company from a given sector, it always depends on concrete information about a company's business model and operational context. Concrete assessment criteria follow the structure of the Non-financial Directive's requirements. For the reporting of climate-related risks, the TCFD criteria were used.
