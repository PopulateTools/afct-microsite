  Additional transparency criteria are provided for specific human rights issues. Ensuring respect for human rights in
  supply chains is relevant to some extent to all large companies. Further specific issues are provided for the Energy

  Therefore the assessment also provides information on how many companies identify these issues as salient and commit
  to prevent or mitigate adverse impacts.
