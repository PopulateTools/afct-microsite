The presentation of information vary significantly across companies. 72% of companies don’t provide KPIs in a single summarised statement and 56% don’t provide information in a clear structure. Many companies refer to information provided outside of the report, but 56% don’t provide direct links to it.

With a few exceptions, companies present at least some non-financial information. However, in only 50% of cases for environmental matters and less than 40% for social and anti-corruption matters, this information is clear in terms of concrete issues, targets and principal risks. Similar results have been recorded for specific environmental and human rights issues.
