Level 1 examines if companies provide the minimum formal set of information stipulated in the Non-financial Reporting Directive. The assessment does not consider if the disclosed information meets the key principles of the Directive, namely materiality and comprehensiveness. These aspects are assessed in Level 2. Because human rights, social and employee matters often overlap, they are assessed jointly in Level 1, but more granular separate assessments of human rights and employee-related disclosures are included in Level 2.
