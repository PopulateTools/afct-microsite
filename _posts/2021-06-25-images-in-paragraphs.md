As you can see, the trick is to add CSS styles to the HTML tag. To position the image to the left or right use "float: left" or "float: right", you can make the image bigger using "width: 100px". And to add separation between the image and the paragraph, use "padding" if the image is on the left "padding-right" and the right "padding-left".

Copy the HTML from the code block here. If you copy from editor to editor, you will lose the HTML formatting.

Any doubt, let me know.
