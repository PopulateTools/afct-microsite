**An interview with Piotr Biernacki, Vice-President of the Polish Association of Listed Companies and member of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) Project Task Force on European Sustainability Reporting Standards.**

Developments on companies' sustainability reporting are ramping up globally.  As the debate continues on the European Union’s proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and associated mandatory standards, Frank Bold talked to Piotr Biernacki, a leading voice from Poland’s business community, on what this reform will bring to companies and the role of EU standards.

*In your experience, what have you seen as the strengths and weaknesses of the existing EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and how can you see that improved in a new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)?*

**Piotr Biernacki:** The two main advantages of today's NFRD are that it introduced mandatory reporting of ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) data and that it is based on the principle of double materiality, which was a revolutionary move in reporting sustainability issues globally. The shortcomings of the current Directive primarily relate to three issues. First, it covers a relatively small number of the largest companies. The CSRD will extend the circle of reporting entities considerably beyond public companies, also reaching out to all large - also private - enterprises and to a certain circle of small and medium-sized companies. Secondly, the NFRD leaves discretion as to the choice of reporting standard, which has resulted in the information provided by companies not being comparable. The CSRD will be accompanied by a set of uniform EU reporting standards, which will not only harmonise the information provided but also adapt it to a digital format. Thirdly, the NFRD did not require an audit of reports, (although a few EU member states have introduced such an obligation). Reports prepared after the entry into force of the CSRD will be subject to verification, which should significantly improve the quality of the information provided by companies.

What do you see as business benefits of the development of European Sustainability Reporting Standards?

Piotr Biernacki: The standards will be issued by the European Commission as delegated acts to the CSRD. They will be drafted by EFRAG, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, which is currently undergoing institutional reform to be able to do this. In the meantime, an expert project group is working on the draft standards, in which I lead one of the working groups responsible for the conceptual guidelines and for a set of five horizontal standards. Once the standards are introduced, reporting companies will have a high level of certainty about what they need and what they do not need to report. The standards will also enable a high level of comparability of information. It will also be much easier to obtain the necessary information from the supply chain - simply by sharing information in similar scope and format. Companies will actually save time in filling out the various surveys and forms which analysts, investors, and rating agencies ask us to fill out today; all this information can simply be extracted from the company reports.

The Alliance for Corporate Transparency research has shown companies find it more difficult to translate risks and impacts of the business to people and planet, into specific targets and then to report continuously in what actual progress is being made in meeting those targets? Do you agree that this should be addressed in the new Directive and Standards, and have you any comment on how this can be achieved?

Piotr Biernacki: I agree that the opportunity exists, but there is no guarantee that the problems will disappear. Companies will need to carry out an analysis of the risks, opportunities, and areas of impact relating to sustainability issues, taking into account the entire value chain and the short, medium, and long term. The conclusions of such an analysis will be necessary for the report. But it is always the case that the analysis can be done robustly or poorly. Reporting standards will not include analytical tools; they are not designed to do so. Instead, they will direct companies towards the result, showing what knowledge the management board should have after conducting the analysis. Fortunately, there already exist tools and methodologies which support quite effectively the identification of ESG risks and opportunities. I am the author of one such tool: the AXIS methodology, which I have recently updated to meet future CSRD requirements.  I have applied it many times in my work with companies, and I have seen how successfully the conclusions of this analysis have been used by management boards to improve the company's business model and to strengthen its development strategy.

Question: There have been calls for foreign-owned businesses operating in the European Single Market and for smaller businesses, in high-risk sectors, to also be subject to the new CSRD and European Sustainability Standards. Do you agree, and what do you see as the benefits in terms of competition and in achieving due diligence for your own company’s supply chain?

Piotr Biernacki: I have not the slightest doubt that this should be the case, and what is more, I am convinced that in time it will be. In the case of small enterprises, however, the challenge is to shape the reporting standards in such a way as to make their application realistic. After all, companies with only a few employees cannot afford to employ one or more people to deal with reporting. Standards for SMEs should be both simple and capable of capturing those areas of impact which are most relevant to people and to the environment, and those ESG factors which most significantly affect a company's current and future financial flows and the capital which it uses. As far as large companies incorporated outside the EU are concerned, they could be subject to the obligations set out in the CSRD, if they generate revenues in excess of a certain threshold within the European Union. But even if this does not happen, I expect sustainability reporting standards to soon cover these companies in their own jurisdictions. Much of the work we do in the Project Task Force is what we call a ‘co-construction’ process: We have a two-way dialogue with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and other standard-setting organisations and institutions. They are all working on the implementation of sustainability reporting standards. The EU is the most advanced, and so today it is the eyes of the world that are on what the European Commission and EFRAG are doing. But others are also designing their standards, and we are trying to ensure that the results of our work are consistent with what will be in place globally in the future.

Question: Which difficulties might Polish companies encounter in collecting and compiling sustainability data for their reports after implementation of the CSRD? What actions can be taken now to overcome the potential obstacles?  

Piotr Biernacki: The difficulty will of course be in learning the new standards, but this will only be a temporary phenomenon - it is always difficult the first time, and easier the second or third time. Companies that today report robustly using standards such as the GRI or the Polish Standard Informacji Niefinansowych (SIN) will have it easier, while meeting the new standards will be more of a challenge for those who have not yet taken ESG reporting seriously. In the first reporting cycle, it can be difficult to get some data from the supply chain. Companies can prepare for these challenges by doing much of the work now. The next year and a half is the time for companies to conduct robust materiality analyses, identify risks, opportunities, and areas of impact, develop sustainability strategies and integrate them into their business strategies, and establish a robust system for managing sustainability issues within the organisation.     

Question: Finally, is the pace of transition to a sustainable economy in Europe and the world sufficient, and what do you hope from the new CSRD and European Sustainability Standards in order to achieve this?

Piotr Biernacki: The CSRD and its accompanying set of standards will accelerate this process. But the pace of change is insufficient. We are all in a fight to the death today, and our competitors are in fact the laws of physics. We will not change them, bend them or defeat them. All we can do is adapt to them. We know what has to be done, only it has to be done immediately because there is no more time. The Paris Agreement, the European Green Deal, Fit for 55, and also the CSRD are mechanisms that are supposed to act as a conveyor belt between the laws of physics and the mechanisms which guide the functioning of economies and societies. That is why it is so important that they are effective and that they are implemented as soon as possible.
