**Ingo Speich, Head of Sustainability & Corporate Governance at Deka Investment** points to the current lack of comparable sustainability data from companies and highlights the importance of social, human rights and governance matters.  

**Which are some of the key sustainability issues you need to assess for companies in your portfolio?**

Companies have to qualify more than just on an environmental level. It's also necessary to include social and governance topics. Key issues are e.g. climate change, human rights, ESG linked compensation and sufficient ESG expertise at board level. Our scope reaches far beyond companies’ borders and incorporates the entire supply chain. Furthermore, we look on inside-out-risks and how boards address such issues. 

**What do you see as the benefits of the development of European Sustainability Reporting Standards for Deka Investment?**

Today we recognize a lack of sufficient ESG data. Data is very difficult to compare among companies. If we can develop a coherent European Sustainability Reporting Standard, we could base our decisions on better information. The coverage of companies would be broader and the data would be more comparable. This clearly improves our investment decisions. Proper disclosure of data must be implemented by companies as quickly as possible in order to derive better results.

**[The research of the Alliance for Corporate Transparency](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/) has shown that companies find it more difficult to translate risks and impacts of the business on people and the planet into specific targets. Do you agree that this should be addressed in the reform of the Directive? How can this be achieved?**

Our observations are very similar. Right now in particular, inside-out-risks and the entire debate about principal adverse impact are not well reflected. Companies should report on the relevant principal adverse impacts and on inside-out-risks on a more granular basis. The CSRD has to cover these data topics, and it needs to be consistent with the SFDR. Investors' milestones have to be communicated, not only on a very long term view, but also rather short term, e.g. with a 3-5 year horizon. 

**Finally, is the pace of transition to a sustainable economy in Europe and the world sufficient, and what do you hope from the new CSRD and European Sustainability Standards in order to achieve this?**

The pace for transition must be increased quickly and significantly. Otherwise we will not reach the climate goals. It’s still a challenge to meet the climate goals even in the future. If decisions are further postponed, it will be almost impossible to reduce carbon emission in time. The CSRD and European Sustainability Standards are challenging for companies and investors, but the efforts are necessary to keep the pace up at a high level. The European Union has to enforce their regulation for companies without sacrificing social aspects.
