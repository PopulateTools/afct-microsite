An interview with Maria José Galvez Cardona, member of board of Directors of Spainsif and ex-Sustainability Manager in Bankia. 

Banks and investors have a crucial role to play in the EU's sustainable finance strategy. To a large extent, it is now their increasing demand for ESG data that drives the sustainability shift among companies. What sustainability information do banks need to assess loan applications? Which difficulties may SMEs encounter when reporting on sustainability matters? Frank Bold asked Maria Jose Galvez Cardona, member of board of Directors of Spainsif and ex-Sustainability Manager in Bankia, the leading financial group in retail banking in Spain. 

**In your experience, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the existing EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive and what improvements do you observe in the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)?**

The NFRD was a good start to harmonize what ESG criteria an organisation has to take into account to manage and report to different stakeholders. One of the weaknesses is the different transpositions of the law in different countries. Furthermore, the NFRD doesn't solicit a standard to communicate ESG criteria, so the comparison of different companies is difficult. Each organisation measures the criteria and KPIs they want.

The most important aspect of the new CSRD is that it promotes a standard so that different stakeholders can have clear and comparable information, and allows to take good investment decisions. International developments should follow the EU example to ensure global competitiveness.

**Which key sustainability issues do you need to assess loan applications from small businesses in particular?**

The purpose of loans and the economic, social and environmental viability are very important for the SME sector, as is the impact of financing.

**What difficulties do your clients (especially small business) have in reporting on sustainability matters, and what can be done to overcome these barriers?**

Most SMEs don't have professional staff to know what they have to take into account to report regarding sustainability, and they don't have money to contract external services. Furthermore, in a small company, there are sometimes set KPIs that don't make sense for them.  

**What do you see as the benefits of the development of European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Standards?**

Companies will provide the same information, so for stakeholders, it will be easier to compare their reporting. Companies will be competing by reporting the same criteria, and measure using the same methodology.

**[The research of the Alliance for Corporate Transparency](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/) has shown that companies find it more difficult to translate risks and impacts of the business on people and the planet into specific targets. Do you agree that this should be addressed in the reform of the Directive? How can this be achieved?**

From my point of view, the most difficult thing is to know how to identify which ESG risks must be taken into account. Even once detected, measuring them is not easy because there are not many methodologies, and the ones that exist are not simple. The teams that have this function must be well-trained.

Regarding impact, we are at a time when much is being studied about it. The good news is that more and more people are wondering about the impact of investments and financing, and this is something that will continue to increase.

**There have been calls for foreign-owned businesses operating in the European Single Market and for smaller businesses in high-risk sectors to also be subject to the new CSRD and European Sustainability Standards. Do you agree, and what do you see as the benefits in terms of competition and your own due diligence?**

I agree with that in general terms because it favours  equal competitive conditions. 

With regard to due diligence, it will be easier to solicit the same criteria to all our suppliers, and promote in this way transparency in supply chains.

**Finally, how do you see the new CSRD and European Sustainability Reporting Standards contributing to the transition to a sustainable economy in Europe and globally?**

I think we are on the right track. However, it is important that companies truly commit to sustainability and keep working on it and improve in this area - Sustainability standards alone cannot be the solution -  Real commitment from different stakeholders can make the difference. I hope that we will have standardised ESG criteria, and even more importantly, that the market continues to drive the demand for this information and realises how important it is.
