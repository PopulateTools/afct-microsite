In 2021, ***the European Commission will present two intertwined*** legislative proposals aiming to foster integration of sustainability in corporate strategies. The first one, the [reform of the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/non-financial-reporting_en) (NFRD), aims to ensure transparency on companiesâ€™ sustainability performance to improve corporate accountability and enable sustainable finance (see our previous article [here](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/news/countdown-reform.html)). The second one, the [sustainable corporate governance initiative](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12548-Sustainable-corporate-governance), will clarify corporate obligations to identify, prevent and mitigate severe human rights and environmental impacts, and Board oversight over sustainability risks, strategy and targets.
