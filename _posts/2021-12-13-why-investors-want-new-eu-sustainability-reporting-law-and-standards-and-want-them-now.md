intro: One of the key drivers to combine regulation with standard-setting for
  sustainability reporting by business in Europe, has come through overwhelming
  pressure from private investors. Frank Bold put together a panel of three
  leading investor voices from Triodos, Robeco and Deka Investments, firms
  collectively responsible for EUR half a trillion assets under management, to
  explore why the proposal is so important to investors and what are some of the
  lessons as EU institutions debate and agree the new directive.

One of the key drivers to combine regulation with standard-setting for sustainability reporting by business in Europe, has come through overwhelming pressure from private investors. 

The voice of the European investment management industry, EFAMA, representing 58 corporate members, [recently called on the EU](https://www.efama.org/newsroom/news/efama-calls-prompt-adoption-ambitious-mandatory-sustainability-disclosures-under) to ’maintain the ambition’ of its new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, (CSRD), adding: ‘Time is of the essence.”

**Frank Bold** put together a panel of three leading investor voices from Triodos, Robeco and Deka Investments, firms collectively responsible for EUR half a trillion assets under management, to explore why the proposal is so important to investors and what are some of the lessons as EU institutions debate and agree the new directive.

There is no doubt that the new regulation is required, amongst the responses.

*“We're happy to see that the regulator focuses on sustainability. More transparency and comparability will help prevent greenwashing by asset managers and financial institutions,”* according to **Roeland Tso, Investment Strategist, at Triodos Investment Management,** which describes itself as a leading globally active impact investor.

Such forthright advocacy in favour of regulation is backed up by investor responses to the European Commission’s public consultation on the proposal for a directive, 

Consistency, comparability and reliability of sustainability information are three often cited arguments in support.

*“Shifting to a Regulation to describe reporting requirements would help improve the consistency of reporting,”* [wrote Ingrid Holmes](http://www.hermes-investment.com/ukw/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fhi-european-non-financial-reporting-directive-response-06-2020.pdf), then Director and Head of Policy at Federated Hermes International.

Such unanimity for the mandatory requirements reflects a huge shift in opinion amongst investors in recent years, reflected in one [international survey](https://www.ftserussell.com/index/spotlight/sustainable-investment-2021-global-survey-findings-asset-owners) of 57 asset managers and owners, in which no fewer than 82% supported the need for regulation.

kkkkkk

As initiatives for sustainability reporting standards are being pursued at both the European and at the global level, our investor panel was equally adamant that Europe must act.

*“If we can develop a coherent European Sustainability Reporting Standard, we could base our decisions on better data. The coverage of companies would be broader and the data would be more comparable. This clearly improves our investment decisions,”* according to **Ingo Speich, Head of Sustainability & Corporate Governance, at Germany’s Deka Investment.**

This view was echoed by our third member, Cristina Cedillo, Senior Engagement Specialist at international asset manager Robeco, who reflected the rising tide of interest in environment, social, governance (ESG) issues within the investor community.

*“The CSRD provides a good opportunity to enhance the quality, relevance, comparability and reliability of information provided by companies. Standardization of data is important for investors to be able to make a fair assessment of corporates' ESG performance and impact to social and environmental issues,”* she said.

Perhaps one of the key reasons behind this investor thinking is, not only in Europe’s commitment to higher social and environmental standards, but that the European developments have and remain key to enabling progress at the global level. 

In its response to the proposal for global standards, Eumedion, the organisation of Dutch institutional investors, [highlights](https://en.eumedion.nl/clientdata/217/media/clientimages/Position-paper-standard-setter-non-financial-reporting.pdf?v=200706115028) the European commitment to a sustainable future and welcomes the *‘leadership role’* which it says has and should be played by the European Union. 

The public policy commitment from the European Commission in this area was acknowledged by our investor panel.

*“Enhancing corporate disclosures is a very positive step, but this is only one piece of the puzzle - as it has become evident under the EU Sustainable Finance agenda and the EU Green Deal. Having access to high-quality sustainability data will bring more transparency to the market on the sustainability performance of companies,”* says Cedillo.

kkkkkkkkk

At a practical level, the investors understand that in order to meet their own obligations for sustainability disclosure under the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), reporting requirements must ensure company sustainability disclosure enables them to do so. 

*“As more transparency is also expected from investors under the EU SFDR, data quality and comparability from investee companies becomes crucial,”* Cedillo adds.

This view was underlined in a [statement](https://dwtyzx6upklss.cloudfront.net/Uploads/z/h/n/priinvestorstatementofsupportforeucorporatesustainabilityreportingdirective_998287.pdf) of support for the proposed CSRD from 54 investors, under the umbrella of the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment.

Big names including AXA and Amundi from France, Generali from Italy, Spain’s Kutxabank Gestion and the Nordic region’s biggest pension fund, SEB, praised the European aim to elevate sustainability information to the same level as financial information. 

*“The CSRD proposal is a prime example of policy coherence between investor and corporate disclosure obligations, building an end-to-end disclosure framework that will enable investors to scale up their contribution to the EU Green Deal and wider sustainability goals,”* the statement says.

kkkkkkk

One of the areas where the European directive and standards are forging ahead, is in looking at a broader range of sustainability issues, whereas the global initiative has decided to concentrate on climate first.

Speich draws attention to the inter-relationship between the different issues: *“Companies have to qualify more than just on an environment level. It is also necessary to include social and governance topics. Key issues are climate change, human rights, ESG linked compensation and sufficient ESG expertise at  board level.”*

Triodos advocates a similar approach, according to Tso: *“We take an holistic approach and do not only focus on climate but also on social matters.”*

Given the importance of financial returns to the investor, it is important to note the strong support given to the European Union’s commitment to ‘double materiality’ in the reporting - putting social and environmental impact of the company alongside the financial impact of sustainability issues on the company itself. *“We look on inside-out-risks and how boards addresses such issues,”* comments Speich.

In a [recent article](https://www.responsible-investor.com/articles/the-eu-the-issb-and-the-quest-for-better-sustainability-data-substance-and-materiality-are-more-important-than-international-alignment), Executive Director of Eurosif - Europe’s sustainable investment forum- called for the EU needs to speed up the CSRD process *“The EU should continue to direct its attention to the adoption of an ambitious CSRD proposal, complemented by a robust set of sustainability reporting standards developed by EFRAG which have the right objective and scope: double materiality across a holistic view of sustainability, including climate change, biodiversity and social indicators. It should then use this to push the ISSB to gradually raise its ambition level in the years ahead.”*

kkkkkk

Despite a commitment to ‘results’ in the EU’s current rules for non-financial reporting, a frequent criticism is that existing company sustainability reports concentrate too much on policies than on outcomes.

The latest [research from the Alliance for Corporate Transparency](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/news/new-data-on-companies-climate-and-human-rights-disclosures-lessons-for-the-eu-reform.html) on reports from 250 companies in ‘high risk’ sectors from Germany, Poland, Spain and the Czech Republic, shows that the vast majority fail to provide the climate information needed by investors and just 15 per cent report on human rights risks in their supply chain.

These criticisms were backed by our investor panel.

*“It is also important to be able to monitor the progress on both sustainability risks and opportunities,”* argues Tso.

*“Our observations are very similar,”* adds Speich. *“Right now in particular, inside-out-risks and the entire debate about principal adverse impact are not well reflected. Companies should report on the relevant principal adverse impacts  and on inside-out-risks on a more granular base. The CSRD has to cover these data topics.”*

There are details in the European proposals which still need to be ironed out, according to the investors.

Cedillo points to the need to get right the division between what is reported at Group compared to entity level, citing the example of water risks for mining companies. “\[This] depends on the type of resource being mined, location, availability of water resources, existence of other users, etc.,” she argues. 

 

Tso points to the difficulties of getting sufficient data from investments in the Global South. *“As asset manager, our investee companies, mostly the smaller companies in developing countries, often have difficulties on collecting data for instance on Greenhouse gas emissions.”*

Nevertheless, he does support arguments for the CSRD to cover foreign-owned businesses, whilst Speich also insists on the importance of sustainability reporting on the company’s value chain. *“Our scope reaches far beyond companies‘ borders and incorporates the entire supply chain,”* he explains. 

This mirrors the [statement](https://media.business-humanrights.org/media/documents/Investor_Statement_mHREDD_FINAL_6_October_2021.pdf) from some 94 asset managers representing EUR 5.7 trillion assets under management, in favour of EU proposals for mandatory human rights due diligence on the supply chain for companies, in which the investors say *“robust European legislation will serve as a benchmark.”* 

Indeed, the need for European sustainability standards is said to answer not create problems - for companies as well as investors. 

*“In our engagement with companies we often hear that the growing number of data demands from a large variety of stakeholders is leading to reporting fatigue. Currently, there are multiple reporting frameworks that companies can use. Simplifying and standardizing reporting requirements could help overcome this reporting fatigue,”* says Cedillo.

kkkkkkk

It is clear that investors have been at the forefront of the argument for existing EU non-financial reporting rules to be strengthened. One more investor statement* which called on the European Commission to expand on the scope of the existing rules, for sustainability information to be disclosed in the actual management report and to ensure mandatory requirements, was jointly signed by Schroders, BNP Paribas and Candrium. 

For our investor panel, the key was not whether these should be done, but how quickly? 

The current rate of progress is not sufficient, according to Tso.

Speich reflected the same need for urgency from European decision-makers, as had the [European investor industry body](https://www.efama.org/newsroom/news/efama-calls-prompt-adoption-ambitious-mandatory-sustainability-disclosures-under):

*“It’s still a challenge to meet the climate goals even in the future. If decisions are further postponed, it will be almost impossible to reduce carbon emissions in time. The CSRD and European Sustainability Standards are challenging for companies and investors, but the efforts are necessary to keep the pace up at a high level”.*

The challenge now is to European legislators - and it is one which comes from private investors, as much as from sustainability advocates.
