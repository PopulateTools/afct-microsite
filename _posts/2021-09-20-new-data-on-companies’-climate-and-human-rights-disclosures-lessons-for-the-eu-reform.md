  the EU reform "

intro: "European policymakers are currently discussing the proposal presented
  this April by the EU Commission for a renewed Corporate Sustainability
  Reporting Directive, which will bring about important changes to companies’
  disclosure obligations, including the development of much expected EU
  reporting standards. New research published by Frank Bold on the information
  disclosed by 250 companies on key climate and human rights matters shines
  light on data gaps and positive trends. "

Since 2018, the previous version of the Directive mandates companies to disclose relevant information concerning both the risks from and impacts on climate and broader environmental matters as well as issues concerning workforce, human rights and anti-corruption. The Alliance for Corporate Transparency has [published landmark studies](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/) showing the progress and shortcomings in the implementation of these obligations with the objective of informing the reform taking place this year. 

Getting relevant and comparable information on the sustainability performance of companies has become the most repeated concern for all users of corporate data, including investors, banks, asset managers, benchmark initiatives, NGOs and trade unions. The fact is that, **despite timid progress, companies’ sustainability disclosures remain too focused on general information and lack specific and meaningful data on risks, targets and key indicators.** 

As the EU experiences a tectonic shift in finance and climate policies in support of a more sustainable and responsible economic model, this brings risks and opportunities of unprecedented scale for all sectors of the economy. The lack of reliable and useful data puts at risk the EU sustainable finance strategy as well as the achievement of the objectives set in the EU Green Deal. Without the right insights from companies’ sustainability performance, it won’t be possible to scale up sustainable finance or increase corporate accountability. 

**For this reason, the European Commission has proposed a new framework to improve and better focus disclosure via the introduction of mandatory sustainability reporting standards,** which should enter into force in 2023 and [help companies](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/news/the-missing-piece-corporate-sustainability-standards-in-the-eu-and-how-they-fit-with-the-investors-disclosure-regulation-and-taxonomy.html) disclose key data that their stakeholders, NGOs and the financial markets need. 

As highlighted in our recent [article](https://bit.ly/2VHtxWc), these standards will alleviate companies’ administrative burden and generate cost savings estimated between 24,200-41,700 EUR for a company each year. The [public consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12129-Revision-of-Non-Financial-Reporting-Directive/public-consultation_en) conducted by the European Commission also showed that 80% of companies who prepare reports support the establishment of common standards. Besides giving clarity and certainty to companies, the standards will consequently enable them to gain easier access to capital and prepare themselves for a net-zero future. 

## What does the new research tell us

**The analysis of key climate and human rights disclosures of 250 companies from high risk sectors (1) in Germany, Spain, Poland, and the Czech Republic show some promising progress in reporting science-based climate targets (2) and describing companies’ human rights due diligence process (3).**

However, **only half of the companies reported climate-related risks, and a vast majority are still lagging behind when it comes to providing more specific information as needed by investors,** such as GHG Scope 3 emissions (4), or accounted for different time horizons in their risk assessments. When it comes to specific information on human rights matters, **85% of companies assessed did not describe their risks and almost none described the management of such risks or the engagement of stakeholders.** 

The data also reveals important gaps between the analysed countries - in most cases, the Czech Republic and Poland stay below the average values. 

**Key results below.** Further key findings per country can be seen **[here](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/assets/2109_2021-research_results.pdf)**.

According to a [major study](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/1ef8fe0e-98e1-11eb-b85c-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-201819497) carried out by CEPS for the EU Commission, there is increased awareness amongst companies on the value and importance of sustainability. Other aspects contributing to this change include the demands of business partners and changing societal preferences. Nonetheless, companies from the survey pointed to the legislation as one major driver for a change in their strategies. The reform of the EU Directive and implementation of EU mandatory sustainability standards is our chance to learn from lessons learned and address remaining gaps.

**(1)** *Predominantly from Energy & Resource extraction, Financial, Food & Beverages, Infrastructure,Resource transformation and Transportation*

**(2)** *The company is aiming at net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or claims that the target is aligned with the 1.5°C / well below 2°C objectives of the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement) or claims alignment with the [Science-based Targets Methodology](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/business-ambition-for-1-5c#start).*

**(3)** *The analysts evaluated [whether all aspects of the due diligence process are described](http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/OECD-Due-Diligence-Guidance-for-Responsible-Business-Conduct.pdf) but not whether the individual steps meet the existing standards and whether they are focused on the most important issues.*

**(4)** *Scope 3 GHG emissions for Financials cover not only impact of their investment but also other indirect emissions, which are a result of the company’s operations, but not under the company’s direct control (eg. business travel).*
