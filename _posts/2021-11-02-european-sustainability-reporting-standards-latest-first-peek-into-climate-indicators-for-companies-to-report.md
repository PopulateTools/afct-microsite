[In previous articles](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/news/categories/#monthly-articles), we have analysed the most important changes included in the EU proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ([CSRD](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en)), and presented mounting evidence around the [benefits of this reform](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/news/the-business-case-is-won-how-the-benefits-of-mandatory-sustainability-reporting-by-business-really-do-outweigh-the-costs-part-one.html) for business, investors, policy-makers and civil society.

**The most significant novelty is the development of mandatory standards that will accompany the legislation.** These will provide clarity to companies on what and how to report and reduce administrative burden, ensure comparability and relevance of information while guaranteeing that investors and all users of sustainability data get the information they need. The European sustainability reporting standards will specify disclosure requirements for all environmental, social and governance (ESG) categories.

**In this article, we first provide an overview of the process and timeline for the development of the European standards as a whole and then move on to explore the content of the first prototype standard published in October on climate reporting.** We clarify which disclosure requirements are mandatory and which are flexible, and explain the connection to existing standards and the broader policy context. **It is important to note that this prototype does not represent the final standard but informs of the current work in progress.**

<h1 id="Context">Context: key information on the process and calendar</h1>

Mandated by the EU Commission, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) set up a project task force that in February 2021 delivered [key recommendations](https://www.efrag.org/Assets/Download?assetUrl=%2Fsites%2Fwebpublishing%2FSiteAssets%2FEFRAG%2520PTF-NFRS_MAIN_REPORT.pdf) on how to develop European sustainability reporting standards. This year, following the CSRD proposal adopted by the Commission in May, the project task force (PTF) has been extended to include around [80 experts and secretariat members](https://efrag.org/Assets/Download?assetUrl=%2Fsites%2Fwebpublishing%2FSiteAssets%2FEFRAG%2520%2520PTF%2520ESRS%2520composition%2520and%2520kick%2520off%2520FINAL.pdf) representing various types of expertise and stakeholders, and tasked with the preparation of a draft proposal for the first set of EU standards (see [Sustainability Reporting Standards Roadmap](https://www.efrag.org/Activities/2010051123028442/Non-financial-reporting-standards#) and visual calendar below).

This draft will be handed over to a permanent EFRAG structure responsible for developing EU sustainability reporting standards, which is being established, early next year. The CSRD proposal stipulates that EFRAG should be responsible for carrying out a due process for drafting, consulting and delivering the proposed standards to the Commission for consideration and adoption. 

In early 2022, EFRAG will finalise changes to its governance structure that will allow it to ensure multi-stakeholder participation and proper engagement of EU as well as Member States authorities.

According to the proposals [outlined](https://www.efrag.org/Assets/Download?assetUrl=/sites/webpublishing/SiteAssets/Jean-Paul%20Gauz%C3%A8s%20-%20Ad%20Personam%20Mandate%20-%20Final%20Report%20-%2005-03-2021.pdf) by Jean-Paul Gauzès (EFRAG Chairman), in order to host the new European Standard Setter (ESS), EFRAG will include a new ‘Sustainability Reporting Pillar’ which will be accompanied by the following structural changes:

* EFRAG's membership will be expanded and will include representatives of European institutions, authorities and agencies,  national authorities and ministries, as well as preparers and users of sustainability data, including civil society organisations; each member category will appoint its representatives to the Sustainability Reporting Standards Board.
* The Sustainability Reporting Standards Board will establish and provide strategic guidance and oversight to a multi-stakeholder Technical Expert Group, which will develop proposals for reporting standards.
* A Consultative Forum composed of experts nominated by Member States will be established to advise the Sustainability Reporting Board Technical Expert Group on draft standards.

**After taking over the work of the PTF and fine-tuning the draft standards, the ESS is expected to launch** a consultation (March-June 2022) to gather public feedback, and submit the final technical advice to the EU Commission for the first set of standards. **Starting in 2023, European companies will have to begin gathering and assessing sustainability data in accordance with the European sustainability reporting standards to be agreed.**

*\*Timeline for CSRD and EU Sustainability Reporting Standards*

**The initiative for the European Union to produce Sustainability Reporting Standards has been widely welcomed, in parallel with international discussions about [global standards](https://www.ifrs.org/projects/work-plan/sustainability-reporting/).** The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) was [officially](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OI72am0jHtDSZ6wmtF2BTevHv4I_Y1BjBFE0w5ch9P8/edit?usp=sharing) launched on 3rd November, at COP26 to deliver such global standards. 

In this context, European active leadership is seen as necessary to maintain the ambition and momentum for the transition to business sustainability, as well as meeting the specific needs stemming from the EU legislative framework on sustainable finance and the European Green Deal.

At present, the proposed international approach would be focused only on climate and specifically on disclosures that are deemed financially material, and would not cover other ESG topics nor the EU’s double materiality approach of risks to and impacts from the company.

The pursuit of both EU and global standards with constructive cooperation between them has been backed by major companies and investors, with the European Commission itself committing to a review process to ensure European and international standards proceed in alignment with one another.

<h1 id="Principles">Principles and objectives for the EU climate standard</h1>

**In September, the EFRAG project task force made publicly available a [working paper on a ‘Climate standard prototype](https://www.efrag.org/Assets/Download?assetUrl=%2Fsites%2Fwebpublishing%2FSiteAssets%2FEFRAG%2520PTF-ESRS%2520Climate%2520standard%2520prototype%2520working%2520paper.pdf)’ which gives a first insight into the future European standards on this specific and crucial issue. The paper itself will undergo further extensive discussion within the project task force before opening to public consultation, but has already been made available as part of EFRAG’s commitment to transparency.**

The prototype responds to the CSRD requirement to ensure transparency around the plans and capacity of reporting entities to adapt their business models and operations to the transition to a sustainable economy and limiting global warming to 1.5 °C.

Following the [double materiality principle](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/assets/double-materiality-diagram.png), the prototype outlines narrative disclosure requirements and specific indicators concerning:

* Climate change impacts and mitigation efforts, in particular as regards energy consumption and GHG emissions; 
* The effect of climate-related risks and opportunities on a company's financial position, financial performance and ability to create enterprise value over the short-, medium- and long-term, including indicators on financial exposure; 
* Governance arrangements.

**The scope of the prototype is strictly framed by the CSRD proposal and aligned with the KPIs needed by investors in line with the [EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/sustainability-related-disclosure-financial-services-sector_en) and EU sustainable taxonomy.** The proposal indicates how it is based on the existing standards, including in particular the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and CDP.

The prototype brings these various pieces together into a coherent structure, presented in three levels:

![](/assets/2111_kpis.png)



<h2 id="Reporting">Reporting on Strategy</h2>

The CSRD will define the disclosures required by companies under its scope on their overall strategy. Under the Directive, companies should report such information for all their material sustainability matters taken together, based on their own determination of what is material. 

As well as topic specific standards - such as the climate prototype - the project task force will develop overarching, cross-cutting standards that will apply to and be relevant for all sustainability matters covered by the future standards. For each individual sustainability issue, the PTF will define further disclosure requirements specific to the given topic.  

The climate prototype addresses a number of specific climate elements that will be included in such anticipated cross-cutting criteria. As opposed to hard requirements in the Performance measurement section of the standards ([see below](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BbhNrZ2A8TxEEahTTT5bhUW_0FotO4f3NXGQ5b1tc3Q/edit#heading=h.26njx2n8tfm6)), these requirements provide companies with a significant degree of flexibility. Companies will need to explain what their strategy is, what their assessment of risks and impacts is and how they affect their business model, and what governance arrangements they have in place to manage sustainability-related matters. The standards will provide criteria for business transparency on such elements, including the description of the overall strategy and assessment of sustainability matters, but will not prescribe the adoption of any particular arrangements. 

**Questions on strategy - the level of detail is up to companies’ based on their own arrangements and assessments:**

<div style="border: 1px solid #DFDFDF; padding: 1em; font-size: .9rem;">

  <ul>

    <li>

 <span>Actual and potential effects of climate-related risks and opportunities on the business model and strategy, including reference to products and services, operations and value chains;</span>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">In addition, the prototype lists several questions which companies will have to respond with clear data, or they would have to declare that they don’t have this information:</p>

    <li>

 <span>Describe the plans to ensure that the business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to limiting global warming to 1.5 °C in line with the Paris Agreement (i.e. transition plan).</span>

 <span>Number of climate-related decisions taken by the Board in the reporting year as shown in the minutes of the Board meetings</span>

</li>

    <li>

 <span>Remuneration incentives on GHG emission reduction and internal carbon pricing</span>

</li>

  </ul>

</div>



<h2 id="Implementation">Reporting on Implementation</h2>

As is the case for strategy disclosures, the implementation level is also defined in the CSRD directly and its details will be clarified in the upcoming cross-cutting standards. However, unlike the strategy level, companies will report information for each material topic separately. 

The implementation disclosures concern transparency on policies and their general objectives adopted by the company to manage each material topic, including measurable targets, action plans and resources. 

At this level, the climate prototype specifies what should be disclosed about the company's  climate change mitigation targets. It does not prescribe that companies have to adopt a target - they will be able to report ‘null’ values. The purpose of the standard is to ensure full transparency and comparability, which is currently not the case. As shown by [the latest research](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/news/new-data-on-companies-climate-and-human-rights-disclosures-lessons-for-the-eu-reform.html) of the Alliance of Corporate Transparency (September 2021), still only 39 % of 250 analysed corporations obliged to report under the NFRD disclosed their climate targets. Only 28 % claimed the targets to be science-based or aligned with the Paris Agreement goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C or well below 2°C. The message to companies from the prototype is that they will have to report their targets in a unified format, making it much easier for users of the reports to find information and work with it, ensuring such information is based on the same metrics and methodologies, and covers the entirety of companies’ emissions at a particular Scope.

**Mandatory information on targets - if companies have them:**

**TABULKA**

<h2 id="KPIs">Reporting on Performance measurement (KPIs)</h2>

The core of the climate prototype concerns metrics and key performance indicators. **This is the only truly mandatory part of the standard. While companies have discretion as regards their strategy, governance, policies and targets, at the performance measurement level, they will have to gather and disclose the required data.**

The climate prototype is based on existing EU metrics, in particular the proposed metrics corresponding to investors’ disclosure obligations under the [Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation,](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Draft%20Technical%20Standards/2021/962778/JC%202021%2003%20-%20Joint%20ESAs%20Final%20Report%20on%20RTS%20under%20SFDR.pdf) and also the EU Taxonomy. It is also aligned with the TCFD, and draws from CDP and GRI standards as well.
