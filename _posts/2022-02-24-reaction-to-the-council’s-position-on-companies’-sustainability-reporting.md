Ministers from EU Member States responsible for the internal market and industry are [expected to approve](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/compet/2022/02/24/) this Thursday 24 February the Council’s general approach on the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) proposal. The agreement at the Competitiveness Council (available [here](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6292-2022-INIT/x/pdf)) will set the position for Member States in trilogues, when the Council will negotiate with the EU Parliament and the EU Commission on the final text before it is officially approved. 

The Slovenian and French EU presidencies have been instrumental in getting Member States to support the EU Commission’s proposal to reform the legal framework for companies sustainability reporting including the swift adoption of mandatory EU standards. 

However, based on extensive and in-depth [research studies](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/) that were followed by specific [policy recommendations](https://en.frankbold.org/sites/default/files/publikace/csrd_analysis_and_recommendations_reform_7.pdf) for the development of the legislative proposal, we are concerned about certain issues included in the common position of 27 EU countries: 

<h1 id="1">1. Scope</h1>

The Council has supported the extension proposed by the EU Commission to cover all large companies and listed SMEs, but it excludes SMEs that are not publicly listed, irrespective of whether they operate in high-risk sectors which need to undergo a transformation. This is problematic for multiple reasons: 

* The sustainability data set out by the CSRD and accompanying standards will influence access to loans and investments for transition financing. Therefore, this exclusion risks leaving them behind in the reallocation of capital to support transition to a sustainable economy, thus undermining the competition for the benefit of dominating, larger companies and leaving national economies with an overwhelming presence of SMEs at a disadvantage.
* Investors and asset managers increasingly incorporate and require sustainability information in order to better understand the risks and opportunities that these issues pose to their investments (i.e stranded assets), as well as to better understand the social and environmental impacts of those investments. Similarly, banks need this  information from all companies to analyse their [own risk exposure](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/publications/newsletter/2021/html/ssm.nl210818_5.en.html) and to fulfil their disclosure obligations. Large companies are also requested to gather information on their business activities, relations and supply chains so they will require sustainability information from smaller companies they’re dealing with. 
* The [Impact Assessment](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021SC0150&from=EN) accompanying the CSRD proposal clearly determined that the explosion of demand for sustainability information from different actors is shown to be the true future cost to business, inevitable unless a more widely accepted set of standards is established. Including SMEs in high-risk sectors in a proportionate and balanced manner is key to provide certainty and enhance their competitiveness.

<h1 id="3">3. Problematic exemption of subsidiaries</h1>

<h1 id="4">4. Supply chain information</h1>

<h1 id="5">5. Forward-looking disclosures</h1>

<h1 id="6">6. Simplified SME disclosure framework is arbitrarily limited</h1>

<h1 id="7">7. Enforcement and penalties scratched</h1>
