Ministers from EU Member States responsible for the internal market and industry [approved](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/compet/2022/02/24/) on Thursday 24 February the Council’s general approach on the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) proposal. The agreement at the Competitiveness Council (available [here](https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-6292-2022-INIT/x/pdf)) will set the position for Member States in trilogues, when the Council will negotiate with the EU Parliament and the EU Commission on the final text before it is officially approved. 

The Slovenian and French EU presidencies have been instrumental in getting Member States to support the EU Commission’s proposal to reform the legal framework for companies sustainability reporting including the swift adoption of mandatory EU standards. 

However, based on extensive and in-depth [research studies](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/) that were followed by specific [policy recommendations](https://en.frankbold.org/sites/default/files/publikace/csrd_analysis_and_recommendations_reform_7.pdf) for the development of the legislative proposal, we are concerned about certain issues included in the common position of 27 EU countries: 

<h1 id="1">1. Scope</h1>

The Council has supported the extension proposed by the EU Commission to cover all large companies and listed SMEs, but it excludes SMEs that are not publicly listed, irrespective of whether they operate in high-risk sectors which need to undergo a transformation. This is problematic for multiple reasons: 

* The sustainability data set out by the CSRD and accompanying standards will influence access to loans and investments for transition financing. Therefore, this exclusion risks leaving them behind in the reallocation of capital to support transition to a sustainable economy, thus undermining the competition for the benefit of dominating, larger companies and leaving national economies with an overwhelming presence of SMEs at a disadvantage.
* Investors and asset managers increasingly incorporate and require sustainability information in order to better understand the risks and opportunities that these issues pose to their investments (i.e stranded assets), as well as to better understand the social and environmental impacts of those investments. Similarly, banks need this  information from all companies to analyse their [own risk exposure](https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/publications/newsletter/2021/html/ssm.nl210818_5.en.html) and to fulfil their disclosure obligations. Large companies are also requested to gather information on their business activities, relations and supply chains so they will require sustainability information from smaller companies they’re dealing with. 
* The [Impact Assessment](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021SC0150&from=EN) accompanying the CSRD proposal clearly determined that the explosion of demand for sustainability information from different actors is shown to be the true future cost to business, inevitable unless a more widely accepted set of standards is established. Including SMEs in high-risk sectors in a proportionate and balanced manner is key to provide certainty and enhance their competitiveness. 

<h1 id="2">2. Phase-in approach</h1>

Member States have also agreed on a calendar to gradually apply the reformed rules and standards. However, the starting year proposed already includes a one-year delay for those companies who already report under the current regime, and two years for private large companies. Multiple stakeholders, including investors, asset managers and civil society organisations [advised against such delay earlier](https://en.frankbold.org/sites/default/files/zpravodaj/multi-stakeholder_statement_csrd_reform_and_eu_standards_1.pdf) this January. **Co-legislators in the EU Parliament and Council should require all large companies to report according to CSRD and EU standards on 2024 (financial year) with reports published in 2025, while providing for an additional year for listed and high-risk SMEs.** As referred above, financial market participants need access to this information and getting it by 2026 or later, is simply too late. The redirection of capital under EU Sustainable Finance strategy, EU Green Deal or the EU recovery plan can not afford to maintain the gaps and issues identified in the EU Commission’s [impact assessment](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021SC0150&from=EN): lack of reliable, comparable and decision-useful information from companies on sustainability matters. 

<h1 id="3">3. Problematic exemption of subsidiaries</h1>

The exemption for companies that are part of corporate groups is further strengthened and includes public interest undertakings as well as those that are part of foreign groups (with a clause to require the sustainability information included in consolidated statements is ‘equivalent’ to EU standards). This is problematic for the following reasons:

* Allowing for the full exemption of these companies will inevitably lead to non-disclosure of important information on resilience and significant impacts of the subsidiaries, because such information may not be considered as material at the level of the group (for instance: subsidiaries that operate in different countries, focus on different activities or incur individual risks and impacts).  
* It is not uncommon that the market in smaller EU Member States is dominated by large subsidiaries of foreign groups. Therefore, this will result in lack of accountability at national level to the public, investors and stakeholders needing these insights. 
* Additionally, EU and global investors deal with both parent companies as well as separate individual subsidiaries in their portfolios and therefore will need comparable and meaningful data to assess risks and opportunities, as well as to fulfil their due diligence obligations concerning impacts on people and planet. 

<h1 id="4">4. Supply chain information</h1>

The Council added a clause that would allow companies to simply say companies in their supply chain “did not make the necessary information available” when not reporting certain information. The added paragraph (29b 2b) provides a rather confusing and unclear message to companies. 

In line with global standards, the requirement to report on the identification of impacts, the actions taken by the company or the results, does not depend on the transfer of information from suppliers. Even for scope 3 GHG emissions, in the absence of data, companies can estimate this. Furthemore, as gathered by the [Corporate Human Rights Benchmark,](https://assets.worldbenchmarkingalliance.org/app/uploads/2020/11/WBA-2020-CHRB-Key-Findings-Report.pdf) most allegations of forced labour, health and safety or child labour take place in developing countries while companies are mostly based in OECD countries

<h1 id="5">5. Forward-looking disclosures</h1>

The Council has proposed to move this reference (originally part of article 19a point 3), connect it to the standards and include an optional approach by adding “as appropriate”. A similar change has been included for consolidated statements of parent companies, as well as fully deleting the references to forward-looking information and leaving a reference to short, medium and long-term horizons to be taken into account during determination of information to be reported. These changes reduce the clarity provided by the EU Commission in their original proposal for companies.

<h1 id="6">6. Simplified SME disclosure framework is arbitrarily limited</h1>

The Council’s position suggests to restrict SME disclosure to a) business model and strategy, b) policies, c) impacts, d) risks, and e) key indicators disclosures, leaving out: 

* **Reporting on targets and plans**, which is paramount to provide reliable insights on how and what the company will do to achieve its commitments and policies on climate as well as other sustainability matters. The CSRD and standards don’t mandate companies to set these, only to disclose information if they have them. 
* **Reporting on due diligence** is central for users of corporate sustainability data to understand how companies determined which impacts they have or could have on people and planet. The Council’s proposal will also not help SMEs to provide relevant information concerning issues in their specific sector.

While it is important to ensure that simplified SME standards are developed (which is already included and planned under the CSRD proposal), the above matters are important to ensure relevant and meaningful data by SMEs. Furthermore, the technical expert group in EFRAG will prepare advice and proposals to the EU Commission for the best way to provide balanced and proportionate standards. 

<h1 id="7">7. Enforcement and penalties scratched</h1>

The current EU Non-Financial Reporting Directly (which the CSRD is reforming) already requires Member States to ensure that effective means of enforcement are put in place. A research [project](https://en.frankbold.org/sites/default/files/publikace/enforcement_activities_corporate_sustainability_reporting_summary_research_s.pdf) implemented by Frank Bold identified some of the worst cases of non-compliance in non-financial statements and submitted formal requests to national enforcement authorities to examine these cases and take appropriate action in accordance with their mandate. The results showed that a) most Member States do not provide a transparent procedure that allows for the examination of authorities’ actions or provide any rights to stakeholders raising complaints and b) no authority indicated it would take any action beyond initial examination that could lead to sanctions or formal notifications of the companies.

In order to effectively tackle greenwashing, which creates an uneven playing field among companies, as well as to ensure public authorities, consumers and other stakeholders can be adequately informed, it is important that enforcement authorities provide public statements identifying companies which breached the requirements and didn’t report required information or did so in a misleading way. 

Additionally, the CSRD should better specify the legal mandate for supervision and enforcement, including the investigative actions and sanctions for specific cases of mis-compliance, as well as procedural rights of stakeholders who submit the complaints.
