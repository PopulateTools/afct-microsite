**Amid current discussions on the shape of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), Frank Bold has developed an FAQ to answer the most important questions around the ESRS.** 

The FAQ aims at helping policymakers and stakeholders understand better why we need the ESRS and what reporting requirements they imply for companies.

The FAQ answers the following questions :

* Why do we need European Sustainability Reporting Standards? 
* Is the EU proposal coherent with the international developments?
* How did EFRAG endorse the draft standards?
* Which disclosure requirements are mandatory ? 
* What value chain information do the ESRS require companies to disclose?
* What do companies have to report on biodiversity?
* What do companies have to report on social issues?
* How do the CSRD and the draft ESRS address phasing-in?
