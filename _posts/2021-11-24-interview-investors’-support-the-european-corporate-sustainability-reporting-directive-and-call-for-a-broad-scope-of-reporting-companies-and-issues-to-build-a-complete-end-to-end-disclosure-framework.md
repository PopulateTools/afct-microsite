**Susanne Draeger, Senior Specialist, Sustainability Reporting at the Principles for Responsible Investment (UN-supported investor initiative),** explains what obstacles should be tackled to bring more clarity and transparency on companies’ ESG performance and impact to the market and enable investors to contribute to sustainability goals.

**In your experience, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the existing EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive and what improvements do you observe in the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)?**

When adopted in 2014, the NFRD was a major step towards greater transparency and accountability on social and environmental issues. However, users of sustainability information, in particular investors, are now demanding more meaningful information from companies about their ESG performance and impact. 

Investors regularly report to the PRI that a lack of consistent and comparable sustainability information is a substantial barrier to their responsible investment practice. This is particularly important for investors in the EU market, who must meet disclosure requirements under regulations such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and EU Taxonomy.

As stated in the Commission's impact assessment for the CSRD, information reported under the NFRD is *'usually not sufficiently relevant, comparable, reliable or easy to access and use'*. The final CSRD must improve upon this by requiring a broader range of companies to report audited, tagged and more detailed and meaningful sustainability information on sustainability performance attuned to progress on sustainability outcomes. 

**What do you see as the benefits of the development of European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Standards?**

PRI welcomes the development of European sustainability reporting standards. We encourage the EU to pursue its leadership role, develop reporting standards that reflect the EU Green Deal's sustainability goals, and contribute to international standard-setting initiatives driven by the IFRS and IOSCO to establish a common global baseline on sustainability reporting. 

Investors are increasingly looking beyond enterprise value and seek to contribute to real-world outcomes and sustainability goals. Corporate sustainability reporting standards should enable investors to do this by providing information on sustainability performance. 

The CSRD proposal provides a template for elevating sustainability information to the same level as financial information. It is a prime example of policy coherence between investor and corporate disclosure obligations. Moreover, it builds an end-to-end disclosure framework that will enable investors to scale up their contribution to the EU Green Deal and broader sustainability goals. 

Finally, the PRI supports the CSRD proposal's approach to sustainability reporting that addresses both financial materiality and sustainability performance as the basis for standardisation. 

**Is the pace of transition to a sustainable economy in Europe and the world sufficient and what do you hope from the new CSRD and European Sustainability Standards in order to achieve this?**

Since its first sustainable finance strategy in 2018, the EU has made significant progress towards creating a regulatory framework that helps to enable the transition to a sustainable economy. However, as highlighted in the revised sustainable finance strategy, some aspects need further progression to accelerate the transition speed.

The CSRD proposal will enable investors to scale up their contribution to a transition towards a sustainable economy in Europe, as initiated by the EU Green Deal. I hope the final CSRDis broad enough in scope, built on robust science-based European Sustainability Standards, and adopted rapidly to support the transition to a Paris-aligned economy.
