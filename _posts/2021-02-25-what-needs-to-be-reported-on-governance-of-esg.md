In 2021, the European Commission will present two intertwined legislative proposals aiming to foster integration of sustainability in corporate strategies. The first one, the [reform of the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/non-financial-reporting_en) (NFRD), aims to ensure **transparency on companies’ sustainability performance** to improve corporate accountability and enable sustainable finance (see our previous article [here](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/news/countdown-reform.html)). The second one, the [sustainable corporate governance initiative](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12548-Sustainable-corporate-governance), will clarify corporate obligations to **identify, prevent and mitigate severe human rights and environmental impacts,** and **Board oversight over sustainability** risks, strategy and targets.

Such a combination of transparency and governance incentives, together with the push of responsible investors, will reinforce the market pressure for companies to elevate the consideration of sustainability among managerial and Board priorities, whilst granting companies considerable flexibility in how they do this.

> EU Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders explained the second initiative to be launched this year, during a [recent event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNZTfEyDuxs&t=30s) organised by Frank Bold and CDSB, by stating that  *“Environmental degradation and climate change are creating risks to businesses and their supply chains. The transition creates big opportunities and companies that are ahead in the game will benefit most. We want to ensure that corporate decision-making changes to a sustainability mindset at all levels. “*

**Currently, a vast majority of companies do not show signs of considering such data, as evidenced by the state of reporting on sustainability from a strategic business perspective.** **For instance,** [the analysis of 1000 large EU corporations](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/database/2019.html)’ non-financial (sustainability) reports by the Alliance for Corporate Transparency revealed that, on average, **only 14% of companies provide insights on the integration of sustainability in core business strategy, Board discussions, and performance incentives**. A follow-up study on the [climate reporting of 300 Southern European and CEE companies](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/database/2020.html) from high risk industries showed an even bigger gap, with results between 7.2% and 10.6%. Forward-looking **information on companies’ strategic targets and progress** is disclosed by less than 10% of companies for climate transition plans, and less than 4% with respect to human rights risks identified by the company. 

In the first part of this article, we explain how the governance of sustainability matters helps companies to identify material sustainability information, and how such data enables companies and their managers to properly consider risks and opportunities and make strategic decisions.\
\
In the second part, we provide an overview of the three areas of information on governance and integration of sustainability that [the reform of the EU Non-Financial Directive](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/news/countdown-reform.html) will seek to clarify (in line with leading existing standards), which are critical for the success of company’s reporting and communication with investors:

> 1. **Company strategy and targets and Board oversight over their adoption and implementation** 
> 2. **Determination of relevant risks and salient issues (double materiality)**
> 3. **Organisation and integration of sustainability in governance**

**The importance of governance in sustainability: the reason behind the EU Commission’s proposals**

Directors’ associations, business organisations and [investors](https://www.ipe.com/ecs-sustainable-governance-play-asset-owners-wary-of-potential-snags/10050702.article), increasingly recognise the urgency of the climate crisis and the need to fully integrate sustainability and respect for human rights in companies’ business models and risk management. The sustainability crisis and the challenge of ensuring recovery from the CoViD-19 crisis are of an unprecedented scale and urgency, as [highlighted](https://youtu.be/BNZTfEyDuxs?t=307) by Commissioner Reynders who also stressed that “companies that are ahead in the game will benefit most”. According to an estimate from the European Commission, at least half a trillion euros of additional investments per year will need to be redirected from business-as-usual to sustainable activities. The risks and opportunities linked to the realignment of finance and markets are therefore equally unprecedented. 

**The need for effective governance and oversight from the company’s most senior governing body and integration of sustainability is proportionate to the challenges facing companies. This is particularly relevant where risks and impacts are connected to the company’s business model, as this will in turn require major changes to the strategy and financial planning.**

> The International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN) is currently updating their global governance principles, and as George Dallas (its Policy Director) highlighted at an event this February, there will be a “big emphasis on the themes of trying to have boards become understanding of not only how ESG factors impact them, but on how their company impacts society in a broader context (...) this, in turn, leads to the need for good information and metrics to guide both executives, board directors, as well as give investors clues in terms of where opportunities and risks might lie.”

\
As the Alliance for Corporate Transparency research on corporate sustainability reporting shows, **the problem is that sustainability information is often invisible to corporate decision makers, which makes it impossible for companies to make fully strategic decisions**. Furthermore, from the point of view of investors and lenders, sustainability information is of little value if it is not clear how it is used by the company and reflected in strategy. Larry Fink, founder and CEO of BlackRock (the world’s largest asset manager), in his notorious annual letter to CEOs,  is directly asking companies in their portfolio to “disclose a plan for how their business model will be compatible with a net zero economy. We are asking you to disclose how this plan is incorporated into your long-term strategy and reviewed by your board of directors”

Frank Bold & CDSB recently organized a webinar on how the EU sustainable corporate governance initiative and the reform of the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive can be focused on helping companies and financial markets to develop and connect sustainability strategies, target setting, transition plans and reporting obligations.

With respect to climate change risks, it is paramount that **energy producers, manufacturers with high greenhouse gas emission intensity, and banks and investors urgently chart their long-term transition plans to survive - and ideally thrive on - the major market changes just beyond the horizon.** A recent [study by CDP](https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/climate/european-companies-invest-124-billion-in-low-carbon) showed for example that European companies had identified €1.22 trillion in new low carbon business opportunities, such as through higher demand for electric vehicles and green infrastructure. The value of these opportunities is more than six times the investment cost of €192 billion. Yet, Alliance for Corporate Transparency found out in its [2020 research](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/database/2020.html) of 300 European companies that less than 17% explain business opportunities related to sustainability challenges. 

A critical step for companies to prevent or mitigate sustainability risks and impacts, is the adoption of targets and proper ways to monitor progress and results.

> Alberto Carillo Pineda, co-founder of the Science-based Targets Initiative, [confirmed](https://youtu.be/BNZTfEyDuxs?t=4808) that a growing number of companies are asking their suppliers to set science-based targets and noted how this would be a key component to accelerate their adoption and institutionalise the practice. In addition, he stressed that other actors and initiatives are pushing towards the same goal “All of these are necessary ingredients to really create an enabling environment and to make SBTs and the adoption of sustainability targets and strategies that are in line with planetary boundaries, our goals, a common practice. The Alliance research positively noted that, in the last two years, there has been a [20% increase](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/news/press-release.html)  in companies reporting science-based targets (improvements are concentrated in Spain with 41% of companies disclosing this type information, reflecting the clarification in the [Spanish transposition of the NFR Directive](https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2018/12/29/pdfs/BOE-A-2018-17989.pdf) that companies should disclose their climate targets )

A strategic approach to the governance of sustainability is also required where companies are connected to severe human rights and environmental impacts through their value chains. Companies will be increasingly expected by market mechanisms and by the law to assume responsibility in this area. In order to achieve the objectives set in the European Green Deal, severe impact by companies to society and the planet need to be mitigated, rather than perpetuating the current model of externalising and dissolving responsibilities across global supply chains. Such systemic problems include large scale deforestation and land grabbing linked to agricultural commodities such as soy, beef and palm oil; exploitation of workforce in garment and footwear supply chains or abuse of technologies by the clients of ICT companies.
