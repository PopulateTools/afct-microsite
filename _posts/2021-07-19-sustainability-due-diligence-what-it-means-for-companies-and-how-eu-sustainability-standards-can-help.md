  sustainability standards can help
categories: monthly-articles
date: 2021-07-19T05:34:15.192Z
intro: Human rights and environmental impacts in European companies’ global
  value chains present a major business risk as well as a challenge to fair
  competition. They are incompatible with the goals of the European Green Deal
  and EU Sustainable Finance agenda.

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Shell case: huge breakthrough for mandatory due diligence and corporate accountability</p>

 <p>The <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBDHA:2021:5339">verdict</a> handed down in May 2021 in the climate case filed by <a href="https://en.milieudefensie.nl/">Milieudefensie</a> in 2019 against Royal Dutch Shell (Shell) has rightly been called historic: Shell must reduce its CO2 emissions by net 45% by 2030 (compared with 2019) regardless of the actions or policies of the Dutch government. But the ruling is historic for other reasons as well: the court based its verdict to a large extent on two soft law standards – the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf">United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a> (UNGPs) and <a href="https://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/48004323.pdf">OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises</a> (OECD Guidelines). In addition, it asserts that companies have an individual responsibility to combat climate change throughout their value chains, and it very clearly links climate change to human rights. This means the judgment is likely to play an important role in the realisation of mandatory due diligence legislation.</p>
