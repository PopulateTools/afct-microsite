For the first time, ESG investment is predicted to overtake conventional investment in Europe, [by as soon as 2025](https://www.pwc.lu/en/sustainable-finance/docs/pwc-esg-report-the-growth-opportunity-of-the-century.pdf). This tectonic change in investment strategies is accompanied by an increasing demand for sustainability information from companies. What challenges do investee companies currently face, and how can mandatory reporting standards help? Frank Bold interviewed **Cristina Cedillo, Senior Engagement Specialist at global asset manager Robeco** with EUR 200 billion assets under management and the member of [Investor Alliance for Human Rights.](https://investorsforhumanrights.org/)

**What do you see as the benefits of the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive proposal and the development of European standards?**

The [CSRD](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en) provides a good opportunity to enhance the quality, relevance, comparability and reliability of information provided by companies. Standardization of data is important for investors to be able to make a fair assessment of corporates' ESG performance and impact on social and environmental issues. As more transparency is also expected from investors under the EU [SFDR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/2088/oj), data quality and comparability from investee companies becomes crucial.

**What difficulties do companies in your portfolio have in including sustainability data in their reporting and what can be done to overcome this?**

In our engagement with companies we often hear that the growing number of data demands from a large variety of stakeholders is leading to reporting fatigue. Currently, there are multiple reporting frameworks that companies can use. Simplifying and standardizing reporting requirements could help overcome this reporting fatigue. However, not all useful disclosures can be captured this way.

Some topics are difficult to quantify and report on, or are very location- or context-dependent and difficult to capture, even if they can be measured. For example, assessing water risks and performance in mining companies depends on the type of resource being mined, location, availability of water resources, existence of other users, etc. In this example, reporting on water performance indicators at an entity level does not provide a full picture on the exposure to water risks and how effectively they are being managed. In these cases, more granular disclosures and industry standards and certification schemes could be pursued by corporates to demonstrate compliance with best practice. Engaging with investee companies is also an important tool for investors to gain a better understanding of companies' sustainability performance and impact.

**[The research of the Alliance for Corporate Transparency](https://www.allianceforcorporatetransparency.org/) has shown that companies find it more difficult to translate risks and impacts of the business on people and the planet into specific targets. Do you agree that this should be addressed in the reform of the Directive? How can this be achieved?**

This is certainly one of the biggest challenges and there is also a need for a framework of impact metrics. The SDGs provide a good framework to measure contribution to sustainable goals, however they are only linked to governments. Extending the KPIs of SDGs to corporates could be one potential solution.

**Finally, how do you see the new CSRD and European Sustainability Reporting Standards contributing to the transition to a sustainable economy in Europe and globally?**

The new CSRD presents an opportunity to raise the quality, accessibility and standardization of sustainability reporting. Disclosure requirements will include reporting on the extent to which companies’ activities contribute to the environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy. Another noteworthy requirement of CSR is the requirement for obtaining external assurance on the reported information. The CSRD also has a broader scope than the existing Non-Financial Reporting Directive, which requires disclosures primarily from listed European companies. Under CSRD, also large (non-listed) European organizations and their subsidiaries will be in scope. 

Enhancing corporate disclosures is a very positive step, but this is only one piece of the puzzle - as it has become evident under the EU Sustainable Finance agenda and the EU Green Deal. Having access to high-quality sustainability data will bring more transparency to the market on the sustainability performance of companies. In combination with the reporting requirements for investors under SFDR and the EU Taxonomy, the EU Sustainable Finance Plan is enabling the  flow of capital towards sustainable activities.
